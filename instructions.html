		 <h1>How to play Scrabble</h1>

		 <!-- Source: https://howdoyouplayit.com/scrabble-rules-play-scrabble/ -->

		 <p>
			In the game of Scrabble, players aim to get the most score by placing down tiles on the board while respecting various rules.
		</p>

		 <p>
			There are three main steps to a turn: 

			1) Play a Word
			2) Draw Tiles to Replace the Tiles Played
			3) Forfeit your turn

			The first player must play his or her first word on the center square of the board, the spot that has a ‘star’ on it. All words must be two or more letters long. <b>Words are played either vertically or horizontally.</b> Diagonal word play is not permitted.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each player must play off of words already present on the board. This may involve changing existing words (for example, making the word ‘play’ into ‘player’) or by incorporating a letter into the word you are playing. <em>You may only place letters in a straight line horizontally or vertically. You can place letters in one direction on a single turn.</em> The letters placed must form complete words. Anytime two or more letters touch, <em>they must form valid, legal words.</em> For example, if you add an ‘s’ to an existing word to make it a plural and then build a separate word from that ‘s’ in the opposite direction, you would get full credit for both words. No tile can be moved or shifted once it is played (baring a successful challenge). 
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>All words in that dictionary that are labeled as parts of speech are permitted.</em> The only words present in a dictionary that are not legal are as follows: abbreviations, prefixes and suffixes standing alone, words that require a hyphen or apostrophe, and words requiring capitalization.
		</p>

		<h2>Score Keeping</h2>

		<p>Each letter tile has the value of that letter. Unless the tile is on a Premium Letter Square, these should be counted at face value and totaled for the word.</p>


		<p>
			According to scrabble rules, there are <b>two</b> types of premium squares: Premium Letter and Premium Word Squares.
		</p>

		<p>
			A light blue square is a Premium Letter Square and it doubles the score of the letter placed on it. These are denoted as "2WS" for a 2X word multiplier, "3WS" for a 3x multiplier, "2LS" for a 2x <em>tile</em> multiplier, or "3LS" for a 3x <em>tile</em> multiplier. The star square is also a 2x word multiplier square as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			When calculating the value of a word that is on a Premium Word Square, Premium Letter Squares should be <em>factored into the word total first</em>. Premium squares only count on the first turn they are used on. If a subsequent turn uses a letter that was previously placed on a premium square, the tile on that square is only worth it’s face value. <b>The only time a premium square is active for more than one word is if more than one word is created with a letter on a premium square on a single turn.</b> Only use premium squares that are under tiles used in a given word when calculating point totals for each word created in a turn. For example, if you create ‘jobs’ and ‘cakes’ by adding the ‘S’ tile to the end of the existing word ‘job’, and the ‘K’ tile is on a red square, you would count ‘jobs’ for it’s face value (13) but you would only triple the value of ‘cakes’ (30) and your total for the turn would be 43 points.
		</p>

		<p>According to scrabble rules, if a player is able to play all 7 tiles in a single turn, in addition to the score for that word, <b>that player is awarded 50 points.</b></p>

		<h2>Finishing the Game</h2>

		<p>
			If 6 or more consecutive scoreless rounds are played, or when one player plays his or her last tile and no more tiles are available to draw, the <em>game is over</em> per scrabble rules. The player with the highest score wins the game.
